## Project Overview

Utilized machine learning techniques to design and develop a model capable of generating short snippets of **Lo-Fi music**. The project leverages **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to learn patterns and characteristics from training sample music data.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Model**: Designed to produce distinctive and original samples.
- **Deep Learning**: Implemented using LSTM for sequence generation.
- **Music Analysis**: Analyzes patterns in training data to create new compositions.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (or PyTorch, assumed based on LSTM)
- **Music21** (common library for music processing)
